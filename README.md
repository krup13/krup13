## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**krup13/krup13** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Hi! I go by krup13!
I am very determined to learn (AKA going on stackoverflow everytime I encounter an error I have no idea how to solve lolol)

I am currently a Software Engineering Major, Bachelor of Computer Sciences Student at University Malaya, Malaysia

if I had to pick one favourite language, it would be TypeScript haha, it's like JavaScript but the run-time errors in JS are compile-time errors in TS (which makes coding in TS much more bearable)
I am proficient in other languages such as Java, C++, Python, the basic stuff haha.

Currently, I am experimenting with Ruby On Rails and Flutter framework.

I hope to meet more amazing devs on here! Thank youuu <3
